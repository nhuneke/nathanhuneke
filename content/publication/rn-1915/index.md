abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The 7.5% CO2 inhalational model can be used to explore potential
  treatments for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it is unknown how inter-individual
  variability in the functional architecture of negative affective valence systems
  might relate to anxiogenic response in this model. METHODS: A total of 13 healthy
  volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive emotional
  face perception task. We explored task-evoked functional connectivity in the potential
  threat system through generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis. Within
  7 days, these participants underwent prolonged 7.5% CO2 inhalation, and results
  from the generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis were correlated with
  CO2 outcome measures. RESULTS: Functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal
  cortex and right amygdala positively correlated with heart rate and subjective anxiety,
  while connectivity between midcingulate cortex and left amygdala negatively correlated
  with anxiety during CO2 challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Response to CO2 challenge correlated
  with task-evoked functional connectivity in the potential threat system. Further
  studies should assess whether this translates into clinical populations.'
