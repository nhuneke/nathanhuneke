abstract: "We carried out the first systematic review to gauge if assessment of blinding was conducted in RCTs investigating medications for ADHD. Put of 161 RCTs form the dataset MED-ADHD (https://med-adhd.org/), we found only one RCT that reported blinding integrity, indicating that assessments of blinding integrity are very rarely conducted in the field. While our findings are not meant to invalidate the evidence on the benefits of ADHD medications, they suggest an opportunity to improve reporting of clinical trials in ADHD."
