abstract: Placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard measure of efficacy in the
  development of new treatments for depression. However, the large placebo effects
  associated with standard measures of subjective symptoms reduce the sensitivity
  of such trials to detect antidepressant effects. There is a need to develop novel
  efficacy markers that are resistant to placebo effects. Measures of emotional processing,
  known to be sensitive to antidepressant treatment, may be such a marker, although
  the effect of an acute placebo treatment on these measures remains unclear. We assessed
  the influence of placebo on a validated battery of emotional processing tasks, the
  Emotional Test Battery (ETB), in healthy participants. Participants were informed
  they might receive the antidepressant drug bupropion, placebo or no treatment, with
  placebo effect being estimated as the difference between the placebo and no treatment
  groups. We found no significant difference between these groups on measures of emotional
  processing. There was also no effect of subjective treatment expectancy on performance
  in the tasks. This suggests that the ETB might be a useful tool for Phase I trials
  assessing novel antidepressant agents against placebo.
