abstract: The lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain could
  explain why we currently have only a few effective treatments. Understanding how
  pain relief is realised during placebo analgesia could help develop improved treatments
  for chronic pain. Here, we tested whether experimental placebo analgesia was associated
  with altered resting-state cortical activity in the alpha frequency band of the
  electroencephalogram (EEG). Alpha oscillations have been shown to be influenced
  by top-down processes, which are thought to underpin the placebo response. Seventy-three
  healthy volunteers, split into placebo or control groups, took part in a well-established
  experimental placebo procedure involving treatment with a sham analgesic cream.
  We recorded ongoing (resting) EEG activity before, during, and after the sham treatment.
  We show that resting alpha activity is modified by placebo analgesia. Post-treatment,
  alpha activity increased significantly in the placebo group only (p < 0.001). Source
  analysis suggested that this alpha activity might have been generated in medial
  components of the pain network, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial
  prefrontal cortex, and left insula. These changes are consistent with a cognitive
  state of pain expectancy, a key driver of the placebo analgesic response. The manipulation
  of alpha activity may therefore present an exciting avenue for the development of
  treatments that directly alter endogenous processes to better control pain.
