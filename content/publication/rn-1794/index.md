abstract: The 7.5% CO2 inhalational model (‘CO2 challenge’) can be used to explore
  potential treatments for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it remains unknown
  how inter-individual variability in the functional architecture of negative affective
  valence systems might relate to the anxiogenic response to CO2 challenge. In this
  pilot study, we explored how connectivity in systems associated with processing
  potential threat (“anxiety”) correlated with behavioural measures of anxiety following
  prolonged CO2 inhalation.The negative affective valence system was identified using
  a passive emotional face perception task. Spherical regions of interest were created
  from peak voxels of significant brain activation when 100 young adult participants
  viewed emotional faces compared with black and white concentric circles during a
  functional MRI scan. Using these regions of interest, generalized psychophysiological
  interaction (gPPI) analysis was undertaken to explore task-evoked functional connectivity
  in a separate group of 13 healthy volunteers. Within 7 days of the scan, these participants
  underwent CO2 challenge and results from the gPPI analysis were correlated with
  CO2 outcome measures.Exposure to CO2 challenge significantly increased subjective
  anxiety, negative affect, systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Functional connectivity
  between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala was positively correlated
  with heart rate. Increased connectivity between the vmPFC and the right amygdala,
  and decreased connectivity between the midcingulate cortex (MCC) and the left amygdala,
  correlated with subjective anxiety during CO2 challenge.Response to CO2 challenge
  was related to task-evoked functional connectivity between regions known to be important
  in processing potential threat. Further studies are required to assess whether this
  translates into clinical populations. Measures of functional connectivity within
  emotional processing networks could be potential biomarkers to enable stratification
  of healthy volunteers, and to examine correlates of response, in trials using experimental
  medicine models.
