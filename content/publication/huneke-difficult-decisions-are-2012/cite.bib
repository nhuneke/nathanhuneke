 abstract = {Patients with learning disabilities are not always involved in decision-making about their medications. This may mean that some patients are unfairly denied of their autonomy. We carried out an audit of current practice concerning consent to treatment in patients with learning disabilities against best practice guidelines. Data were collected via a questionnaire given to a sample of 70 patients with learning disabilities within the Salford catchment area. This questionnaire assessed whether patients were involved in decision-making regarding their medications and whether they were being given enough information to give informed consent. A total of 45 patients completed questionnaires. Overall, the patients’ knowledge of their medications was poor, particularly of the proposed duration, possible disadvantages and name of the treatment. It appears that doctors are engaging these patients during consultations and discussing their medications. However, the delivery of this information needs to be improved, and patients’ understanding and recall need to be checked more thoroughly.},
