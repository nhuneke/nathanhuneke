abstract: Placebos are not inert, but exert measurable biological effects. The placebo
  response in psychiatric illness is important and clinically relevant, but remains
  poorly understood. In this paper, we review current knowledge about the placebo
  response in psychiatric medicine and identify research directions for the future.
  We argue that more research is needed into the placebo response in psychiatric medicine
  for three broad reasons. First, awareness of factors that cause placebo response,
  for whom, and when, within clinical trials will allow us to better evidence efficacy
  of new treatments. Second, by understanding how placebo mechanisms operate in the
  clinic, we can take advantage of these to optimise the effects of current treatments.
  Finally, exploring the biological mechanisms of placebo effects might reveal tractable
  targets for novel treatment development.
