abstract: 'Rheumatic pain and, in particular, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis
  and fibromyalgia, are common and debilitating chronic pain syndromes. Recently,
  human functional neuroimaging, for example EEG, fMRI, and PET has begun to reveal
  some of the crucial central nervous system mechanisms underlying these diseases.
  The purpose of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the brain mechanisms
  of rheumatic pain revealed by functional neuroimaging techniques. The evidence suggests
  that two mechanisms may be largely responsible for the clinical pain associated
  with these rheumatic diseases: abnormalities in the medial pain system and/or central
  nervous system sensitisation and inhibition. If we can understand how functioning
  of the central nociceptive system becomes altered, even in the absence of peripheral
  nociceptive input, by using functional neuroimaging techniques, in the future we
  may be able to develop improved, more effective treatments for patients with chronic
  rheumatic pain.'
