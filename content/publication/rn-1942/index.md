abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying placebo effects of psychotropic drugs
  remain poorly understood. We carried out the first systematic review of functional
  neuroimaging correlates of placebo response in adults with anxiety/depressive disorders.
  METHODS: We systematically searched a large set of databases up to February 2021
  based on a pre-registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42019156911). We extracted neuroimaging
  data related to clinical improvement following placebo or related to placebo mechanisms.
  We did not perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of included studies and
  significant heterogeneity in study design and outcome measures. RESULTS: We found
  12 relevant studies for depressive disorders and four for anxiety disorders. Activity
  in the ventral striatum, rostral anterior cingulate cortex and other default mode
  network regions, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex correlated
  with placebo antidepressant responses. Activity in regions of the default mode network,
  including posterior cingulate cortex, was associated with placebo anxiolysis. There
  was also evidence for possible involvement of the endogenous opioid, dopamine and
  serotonin systems in placebo antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. CONCLUSIONS:
  Several brain regions and molecular systems may be involved in these placebo effects.
  Further adequately powered studies exploring causality and controlling for confounders
  are required.'
