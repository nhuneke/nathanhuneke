 abstract = {Interoception is defined as the sense of the internal state of the body. Dysfunctions in interoception are found in several mental disorders, including trauma-related conditions. Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) have been shown to influence interoceptive processes. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated whether MBIs impact symptoms and interoception in patients with trauma-related disorders. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize these data. We included RCTs with an MBI arm which enrolled adult patients with trauma related-disorders or exposure to a traumatic experience, and addressed changes in interoception and trauma-related symptoms. A random-effects multivariate meta-analytic model was performed to quantify group differences in score change from baseline to follow-up. Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, and eleven in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBIs showed small to moderate positive effects on both interoception and symptoms. Despite a high heterogeneity in results, sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. We conclude that the efficacy of MBIs on trauma-related symptoms and interoception is supported by randomised evidence. However, further research is needed to understand whether changes in interoception might underpin the effectiveness of MBIs in trauma-related disorders.},
