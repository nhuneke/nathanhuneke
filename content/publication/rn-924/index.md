abstract: 'Background: Previous research indicates that antidepressants can restore
  the balance between negative and positive emotional processing early in treatment,
  indicating a role of this effect in later mood improvement. However, less is known
  about the effect of antidepressants on reward processing despite the potential relevance
  to the treatment of anhedonia. In this study, we investigated the effects of an
  acute dose of the atypical antidepressant (dual dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake
  inhibitor) bupropion on behavioral measures of emotional and reward processing in
  healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty healthy participants were randomly allocated
  to double-blind intervention with either an acute dose of bupropion or placebo prior
  to performing the Emotional Test Battery (ETB) and a probabilistic instrumental
  learning task. Results: Acute bupropion significantly increased the recognition
  of ambiguous faces as happy, decreased response bias toward sad faces and reduced
  attentional vigilance for fearful faces compared to placebo. Bupropion also reduced
  negative bias compared to placebo in the emotional recognition memory task (EMEM).
  There was no evidence that bupropion enhanced reward processing or learning. Instead,
  bupropion was associated with reduced likelihood to choose high-probability wins
  and increased score on a subjective measure of anhedonia. Conclusions: Whilst acute
  bupropion decreases negative and increases positive emotional processing, it has
  an adverse effect on reward processing. There seems to be a dissociation of the
  acute effects of bupropion on positive emotional processing and reward processing,
  which may have clinical implications for anhedonia early in treatment.'
