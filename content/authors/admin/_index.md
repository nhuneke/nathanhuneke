I am an NIHR Academic Clinical Lecturer at the University of Southampton, UK. 

I am interested in the mechanisms that cause anxiety and affective disorders, which I explore through research with experimental models of anxiety and neuroimaging of emotional processing. 

I am also interested in understanding the mechanisms of the placebo and nocebo responses in mental disorders.
