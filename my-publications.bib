   abstract = {The lack of clear understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain could explain why we currently have only a few effective treatments. Understanding how pain relief is realised during placebo analgesia could help develop improved treatments for chronic pain. Here, we tested whether experimental placebo analgesia was associated with altered resting-state cortical activity in the alpha frequency band of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Alpha oscillations have been shown to be influenced by top-down processes, which are thought to underpin the placebo response. Seventy-three healthy volunteers, split into placebo or control groups, took part in a well-established experimental placebo procedure involving treatment with a sham analgesic cream. We recorded ongoing (resting) EEG activity before, during, and after the sham treatment. We show that resting alpha activity is modified by placebo analgesia. Post-treatment, alpha activity increased significantly in the placebo group only (p < 0.001). Source analysis suggested that this alpha activity might have been generated in medial components of the pain network, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and left insula. These changes are consistent with a cognitive state of pain expectancy, a key driver of the placebo analgesic response. The manipulation of alpha activity may therefore present an exciting avenue for the development of treatments that directly alter endogenous processes to better control pain.},

   abstract = {Placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard measure of efficacy in the development of new treatments for depression. However, the large placebo effects associated with standard measures of subjective symptoms reduce the sensitivity of such trials to detect antidepressant effects. There is a need to develop novel efficacy markers that are resistant to placebo effects. Measures of emotional processing, known to be sensitive to antidepressant treatment, may be such a marker, although the effect of an acute placebo treatment on these measures remains unclear. We assessed the influence of placebo on a validated battery of emotional processing tasks, the Emotional Test Battery (ETB), in healthy participants. Participants were informed they might receive the antidepressant drug bupropion, placebo or no treatment, with placebo effect being estimated as the difference between the placebo and no treatment groups. We found no significant difference between these groups on measures of emotional processing. There was also no effect of subjective treatment expectancy on performance in the tasks. This suggests that the ETB might be a useful tool for Phase I trials assessing novel antidepressant agents against placebo.},

   abstract = {Background: Previous research indicates that antidepressants can restore the balance between negative and positive emotional processing early in treatment, indicating a role of this effect in later mood improvement. However, less is known about the effect of antidepressants on reward processing despite the potential relevance to the treatment of anhedonia. In this study, we investigated the effects of an acute dose of the atypical antidepressant (dual dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) bupropion on behavioral measures of emotional and reward processing in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty healthy participants were randomly allocated to double-blind intervention with either an acute dose of bupropion or placebo prior to performing the Emotional Test Battery (ETB) and a probabilistic instrumental learning task. Results: Acute bupropion significantly increased the recognition of ambiguous faces as happy, decreased response bias toward sad faces and reduced attentional vigilance for fearful faces compared to placebo. Bupropion also reduced negative bias compared to placebo in the emotional recognition memory task (EMEM). There was no evidence that bupropion enhanced reward processing or learning. Instead, bupropion was associated with reduced likelihood to choose high-probability wins and increased score on a subjective measure of anhedonia. Conclusions: Whilst acute bupropion decreases negative and increases positive emotional processing, it has an adverse effect on reward processing. There seems to be a dissociation of the acute effects of bupropion on positive emotional processing and reward processing, which may have clinical implications for anhedonia early in treatment.},

   abstract = {The 7.5% CO2 inhalational model (‘CO2 challenge’) can be used to explore potential treatments for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it remains unknown how inter-individual variability in the functional architecture of negative affective valence systems might relate to the anxiogenic response to CO2 challenge. In this pilot study, we explored how connectivity in systems associated with processing potential threat (“anxiety”) correlated with behavioural measures of anxiety following prolonged CO2 inhalation.The negative affective valence system was identified using a passive emotional face perception task. Spherical regions of interest were created from peak voxels of significant brain activation when 100 young adult participants viewed emotional faces compared with black and white concentric circles during a functional MRI scan. Using these regions of interest, generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis was undertaken to explore task-evoked functional connectivity in a separate group of 13 healthy volunteers. Within 7 days of the scan, these participants underwent CO2 challenge and results from the gPPI analysis were correlated with CO2 outcome measures.Exposure to CO2 challenge significantly increased subjective anxiety, negative affect, systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala was positively correlated with heart rate. Increased connectivity between the vmPFC and the right amygdala, and decreased connectivity between the midcingulate cortex (MCC) and the left amygdala, correlated with subjective anxiety during CO2 challenge.Response to CO2 challenge was related to task-evoked functional connectivity between regions known to be important in processing potential threat. Further studies are required to assess whether this translates into clinical populations. Measures of functional connectivity within emotional processing networks could be potential biomarkers to enable stratification of healthy volunteers, and to examine correlates of response, in trials using experimental medicine models.},

In this paper, we review current knowledge about the placebo response in psychiatric medicine and identify research directions for the future. We argue that more research is needed into the placebo response in psychiatric medicine for three broad reasons. First, awareness of factors that cause placebo response, for whom, and when, within clinical trials will allow us to better evidence efficacy of new treatments. Second, by understanding how placebo mechanisms operate in the clinic, we can take advantage of these to optimise the effects of current treatments. Finally, exploring the biological mechanisms of placebo effects might reveal tractable targets for novel treatment development.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying placebo effects of psychotropic drugs remain poorly understood. We carried out the first systematic review of functional neuroimaging correlates of placebo response in adults with anxiety/depressive disorders. METHODS: We systematically searched a large set of databases up to February 2021 based on a pre-registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42019156911). We extracted neuroimaging data related to clinical improvement following placebo or related to placebo mechanisms. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to the small number of included studies and significant heterogeneity in study design and outcome measures. RESULTS: We found 12 relevant studies for depressive disorders and four for anxiety disorders. Activity in the ventral striatum, rostral anterior cingulate cortex and other default mode network regions, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex correlated with placebo antidepressant responses. Activity in regions of the default mode network, including posterior cingulate cortex, was associated with placebo anxiolysis. There was also evidence for possible involvement of the endogenous opioid, dopamine and serotonin systems in placebo antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Several brain regions and molecular systems may be involved in these placebo effects. Further adequately powered studies exploring causality and controlling for confounders are required.},
